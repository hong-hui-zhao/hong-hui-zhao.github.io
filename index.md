### Honghui's personal space

<br/>

Zhao Honghui, an undergraduate student majoring in bioinformatics at Lanzhou University, has joined Professor Shi Lei's research group to study and undertake a small project on his own, which mainly uses bioinformatics methods and public single cell data sets to explore the biological function of long non-coding RNA in the microenvironment of non-small cell lung cancer tumors.

My programming language is R, I am currently learning Python, and I can also use linux systems.
